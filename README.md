HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:
1. make sure you have npm and mongodb install in your machine
2. npm i to install all the neccessary packages
3. make sure to have an account to be able to use Cloudinary and Mapbox API, after that, create a .env file:
CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME = <yours>
CLOUDINARY_KEY = <yours>
CLOUDINARY_SECRETE = <yours>
MAPBOX_TOKEN = <yours>
4. run nodemon app.js and you're good to go, admin account can be register manually with the username being 'admin', sorry if that sounds stupid :(
